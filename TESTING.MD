## Bugs
+ ### Solved bugs
    1. In Contact Us page I accidentally put type-text in the email form.
  *Solutions:* Fixed to type-email.
    2. I used a container several times when I didn't need it. 
    *Solution:* remove unnecessary containers.
    3. Used float and margin, which made the page deform when resizing. 
    *Solution:* almost all float and margin were replaced, which made the page more responsive.

+ ### Unsolved bugs
    - When I commit it's like it's not in my name, but I can't do anything about that unfortunately.
